			<p class="font profile-content">Grant is always increasing his skill in some way or another. Whether it's in the form of gaining new skills, like cooking, fabricating customized viking axes, or education (or video games), he is always trying to improve himself. The primary means of doing so is currently enrolling at BSU in the GIMM program, with the end goal of using these skills to better the educational program at which he is employed.</p>

                I love to learn. I have a Bachelor’s in Philosophy, which I believe is an excellent tool for truth and self-discovery.
                I am currently working on my second degree in Gaming and Interactive Media at Boise State.
                It is my goal to create virtual reality games and short films that will increase public awareness and action for global conservation.
